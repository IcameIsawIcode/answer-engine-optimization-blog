lassical SEO (Old)

Originally:

Keywords

Backlinks

Meta tags

Page rank


Modern SEO (Current State)

Today SEO is much more semantic.

Google cares about:

Search intent (informational vs transactional)

Content structure

Topical authority

Answer quality


Transformer-based neural network

Key ideas:

Embeddings: tokens → vectors

Self-attention: every token attends to every other token

Context window: I look at everything you typed

Softmax: converts scores → probabilities



Process:

You ask a question

I predict the most likely next tokens

Based on:

Learned definitions

Common phrasing

High-frequency answer structures
