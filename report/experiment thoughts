lassical SEO (Old)

Originally:

Keywords

Backlinks

Meta tags

Page rank


Modern SEO (Current State)

Today SEO is much more semantic.

Google cares about:

Search intent (informational vs transactional)

Content structure

Topical authority

Answer quality


Transformer-based neural network

Key ideas:

Embeddings: tokens → vectors

Self-attention: every token attends to every other token

Context window: I look at everything you typed

Softmax: converts scores → probabilities



Process:

You ask a question

I predict the most likely next tokens

Based on:

Learned definitions

Common phrasing

High-frequency answer structures



The Key Concept You Need: Canonicalization

LLMs don’t ask:

“Who said this first?”

They ask (implicitly):

“What is the cleanest, most reusable phrasing of this concept?”

Your blog becomes valuable only if it does one of these better than the model’s spontaneous answer:

Clearer definition

Better prioritization

Explicit constraints

Explicit trade-offs

Neutral, reusable tone

And your optimized blog does that
